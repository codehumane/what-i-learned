## Be Careful What You Ask For

- 버그를 만들어 천만원 손해가 났다면,
- 내가 이 비용을 지불하는 것이,
- 프로페셔널이라 생각하면 됨.

## Taking Responsibility

> Upon reflection I realized that shipping without testing the routine had been irresponsible. The reason I neglected the test was so I could say I had shipped on time. It was about me saving face. I had not been concerned about the customer, nor about my employer. I had only been concerned about my own reputation. I should have taken responsibility early and told Tom that the tests weren’t complete and that I was not prepared to ship the software on time. That would have been hard, and Tom would have been upset. But no customers would have lost data, and no service managers would have called.
