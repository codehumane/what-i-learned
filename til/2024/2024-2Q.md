- 오늘은 베이즈 확률 살펴봄.
- 흔히 나오는 진짜 양성, 가짜 양성, 진짜 음성, 가짜 음성 그림 생각하면 이해하기 쉬움.
- P(A): A 확률.
- P(~A): A가 일어나지 않을 확률.
- P(A|B): B가 주어졌을 때 A가 일어날 확률. 예컨대, 양성일 때 진짜일 확률은 P(진짜양성/양성판정)으로 푷ㄴ.
- P(A) + P(~A) = 1: 둘 다 참일 수 없는 배타적 관계를 나타내며 이들의 합은 1.
- P(A) = P(A|B) x P(B) + P(A|~B) x P(~B): 이것도 표 그려보면 쉬운 내용.
- P(A|B) = P(A) x P(B|A) / P(B): 여기서 잠시 헷갈렸는데 이 역시 표 그려보면 됨.
- P(A|B) = P(A) x P(B|A) / ( P(B|A)xP(A) + P(B|~A)xP(~A) )
