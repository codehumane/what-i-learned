- 기존의 O(N^2)는 Time Limit Exceeded.
- [O(N)으로 풀이](https://github.com/codehumane/algorithm/commit/c621ee30ee71a031f110bf9ff5d26abe7a3834f3)
- O(N)은 직접 생각해서 풀지 못했고, [풀이](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/solution/)를 보며 따라감.
- 트리가 아니라 원으로 바라보는 것이 핵심.
- 그리고 그 원의 중심을 찾는 것.
- 이 원의 중심은 최단 높이를 갖는 루트 노드가 됨.
- 이 중심 노드들은 최대 2개까지 밖에 없음을 증명하는 부분도 흥미로움.
- 아이디어만 생각해 낼 수 있다면(첨부터 스스로 생각해 내기는 쉽지 않아 보임) 구현은 간단.
